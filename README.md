## Shoe Exploration Site
* The main feature of the site is that you can click on a picture of a shoe and it will bring you to a page with more information about that shoe.
* You can also sort the shoes by type on the main page, and you can put them all on the page if you want to.
* Also, on click of a shoe, we use the google search API to search google for the name of the shoe and display the top results on the page with the shoe.
* You can click on the links provided by the google search, and you can see the name of the website and a description of the specific result.
